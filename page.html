<tr><th><font size="4"><font color="009999"><center>- INTRODUCTION -</center></font></th></tr>

<tr><td><center>Congratulations! If you're reading this, it means you're taking the first steps towards a brighter future for YOUR valuables with TERMINUS VAULTS. The purpose of this digital pamphlet, made available on-request to selected inquirers meticulously chosen from our many potential applicants to ensure maximum compatibility with the most secure banking facility in the Dimension-Collective, is to outline the nature and goal of our institution and to demonstrate why we are the correct choice for all your banking needs.</center><br/><br/></td></tr>



<tr><th><font size="4"><font color="009999"><center>- POLICY -</center></font></th></tr>

<tr><td><center>We respect that all bankgoers are selective with the establishment they entrust their belongings to, and we ask that we be allowed a degree of that selectivity in accepting our clients in turn-- Here at Terminus we strongly value the principles of a two-way system, and this exclusivity allows us to ensure that our privately-funded institution has the most productive relationship possible with each and every one of our clients. We don't want anyone wasting our time or yours!</center><br/><br/></td></tr>


<tr><th><font size="4"><font color="009999"><center>- HISTORY -</center></font></th></tr>

<tr><td><center>Nobody knows what caused THE BREACH - The quantum storm observed during the 22nd Century that both revealed a new form of black hole and confirmed the existence of Novikov's white hole, a long-hypothesized "anti-black hole" from which light and matter are constantly projected but which cannot be entered from the outside. Whatever the cause, the observation of this unprecedented anomaly redefined what we knew about quantum mechanics and universal wavefunction, and the years that followed were the boom period of intellectual prosperity that laid the foundation for TERMINUS VAULTS to become what it is today! While the world's leading quantum physicists were using the data to perfect matter-transfer and establish groundbreaking contact with the inhabited parallel universes that would become today's Dimension-Collective, our founder's private institution instead continued looking towards the stars above our own world. Just when it was believed the Breach had given up all its secrets, our founding scientists found more: The black and white holes formed from the quantum event, once thought to exist simultaneously in two different regions, were in fact the same object existing in differing stages of relativity! In essence, the formation of the Breach brought about a state of space-time harmony that defied conventional quantum mechanics and allowed a region of space to exist in two different states at the same time. Though some of our science remains a closely-guarded secret, the Terminus Vaults Facility was built by exploiting the conflicting nature of these states to discover an equilibrium that doubled as a foundation for something many would've deemed impossible; Because, as you're surely aware if you've heard of us-- Terminus Vaults is the only bank to construct its facility atop the event horizon of a black hole!</center><br/><br/></td></tr>

<tr><th><font size="4"><font color="009999"><center>- PERSONNEL -</center></font></th></tr>

<tr><td>All personnel at Terminus live their lives entirely on-location, with their needs, lodgings and families all catered for to the highest reasonable standard and on-hours movements constantly monitored. They are forbidden by dimensional law to leave the facility while employed, and our tiered clearance system means the only people handling your savings and valuables will be the ones who are with us for life!<br/><br/></td></tr>

<tr><th><font size="4"><font color="009999"><center>- VAULTS -</center></font></th></tr>

<tr><td><center>Though we do deal in digital currency banking, our main appeal is, of course, our vaults and strongboxes for material valuables. These impenetrable structures are the heart of Terminus, figuratively and literally: They exist inside the black hole itself! What better place to keep your most precious artifacts safe than the place the universe itself ends?</center><br/><br/></td></tr>

<tr><th><font size="4"><font color="009999"><center>- WHY BANK WITH US? -</center></font></th></tr>

<tr><td><center>Many who dismiss the accomplishment of building a high-security bank outside a singularity as a gimmick follow up with this question-- Why opt for a gimmick at all, let alone one so expensive? Why not settle for a cheaper alternative, such as the Bank of Karabraxos or the wizarding world's Gringotts? And to these people, we like to let results do the talking. We maintain a 100% reliability record: Terminus has never suffered a successful robbery, infiltration or break-in of any kind, and no attempt has ever progressed further than our planetoid-compound's first level. To put in perspective precisely how ineffectual these efforts were, Terminus is approximately the diameter of Earth's moon - And our premium vaults are located past the event horizon, within the depths of the black hole itself, accessible only by our secure matter-transfer systems from the planetoid's airtight lower regions. Any attempt to access these vaults without an absolute replication of our specific procedure, known only to a select few personnel, would result in any would-be master criminal meeting their end by being dashed against the complete endlessness of a black hole; Superhuman wild cards are handled by our quantification systems, which ensure metahumans of significant power are immediately identified upon arrival, closely monitored and subject to different and more scrutinizing security procedures than our regular customers. Stasticially speaking, a robbery is about as close to impossible as you can get, so when it comes to security Terminus Vaults truly can't be beaten! Because remember, while radiation can escape a black hole...</center><br><br>
